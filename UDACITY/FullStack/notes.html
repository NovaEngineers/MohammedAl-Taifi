        <p>Markup is a symbol or character that you insert at certain place in a text file.<br> This represents how the
            file should look (<b>bold</b>, <em>italic</em>, link, etc) when it is printed in your browser.
            <br>Also the markup indicators are often called <em>"tags."</em></p>

            Great!

            p and li are the two elements you've seen with optional closing tags. And the browser knows there has to be
            a closing tag when it gets to the start tag of a new element that can't be inside of the last one. For
            example, when it gets to the start of a new p element, it knows the previous p element must be closed.

            When you put things in your own words, this helps you understand and remember the concepts betterâ€”but don't
            worry about making it perfect. If you're a little unsure of something, just take a shot at it. This effort
            by itself will help you develop your understanding when you encounter that concept again.
